This is the picture when we actually 3D printed the pokemon ball and painted it.

This is what the inside looks like virually and this is how it looks in person.

The red switch is when we are switching bewteen code mode and data mode. Red wire = code mode Black wire = data mode 

### What are the requirements for this assignment?
The requirements for this project are pico, GPS, PowerBoost, Accelerometer, Breadboard, USB adapter, Wires, bolts and nuts.

### Progress pictures

This is what our first design looked like. We didn't really knew how our design would look like, so we came up with this design.

## Final_Reflections
 
### CAD Relection-Mariam
In the beginning we had no idea how we want this project to look like, so we started our first design with a dog bowl, then we went from dog bowl to a Pokemon shape. At first it was kind of confusing on how to create a bowl shape. Then Mr. Miller told us that we can use the revolve tool to make a bowl. I knew the revolve tool, but I never knew how to use it, so learning how to use the revolve tool was really interesting and helpful. It was kind of diffcult 

### Code Relection-Hope
In the beginning of this project I was very dejeced and had little hope for this project since it was our back up plan. I did not kne
