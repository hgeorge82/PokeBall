## Pokemon ball project
### Objective
With the slingshot we're gonna shoot the pokemon ball and measure the altitude and speed with GPS.

This is the picture when we actually 3D printed the pokemon ball and painted it.

This is what the inside looks like virually and this is how it looks in person.

The red switch is when we are switching bewteen code mode and data mode. Red wire = code mode Black wire = data mode

This is the final look, the reason why the bottom is a different color because we re-printed the bottom because the supports were broken

### What are the requirements for this assignment?
The requirements for this project are pico, GPS, PowerBoost, Accelerometer, Breadboard, USB adapter, Wires, bolts and nuts.

### Progress pictures

This is what our first design looked like. We didn't really knew how our design would look like, so we came up with this design.

This is our final drawing

This is how everything will be on a breadboard.

Today we got our pokemon ball printed. We put the board inside the pokemon ball to see if it fits. Only 2 holes places are in the right place I am not sure why the other holes are not in the right place, but it still works and the board is where it suppose to be, overall all it was good

This is right after we did the atcual first launched, you can that it hit the ground pretty hard, a lot of damage was done to it

This is when we first opend the ball, when we opened it the pico got stuck on the top you can see the spot of the pico. You can also see that the GPS, powerboost came out of the headers and the puzzer is broken
<img src="https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/blob/main/Pictures/together.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
This is from our first launched, as you see the puzzer is fully broken, everything is missplaced (got out of the headers)

<img src="https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/blob/main/Pictures/new%20supports.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
This is after the 2nd launch, as you see the supports were broken, so we had to recreate it and make the supports stronger. We made the support thicker, and added these threaded inserts, so that it's easier to put the screws in.

<img src="https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/blob/main/Pictures/top%20added%20foam.JPG?raw=true" width="400">
This is the bottom of the pokemon ball, we added foam to prevent the pico-board from moving and we did the same thing at the top

## Launches 
![first launch](https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/assets/71345399/3e25ce41-f69f-438a-8127-bb3f8a4d066d)
This is our first test launch, the launch was ok, some materials inside it got missplaced, but overall it was good

This is our 1st actually launch. we did 2 launches this day, because why not you know. We had a pretty good lauch, but it hit the ground pretty hard and a lot of damage was done to it. For instance the ball was creaked open, and all of the materials inside it were broken, the pico support was broken and the pico support was broken

This is our 3rd launch, some materials did got misplaced, but no damged was done



## Final_Reflections
 
### CAD Relection-Mariam
This year has been a really challenging roller-coaster. In the beginning we had no idea how we want this project to look like, so we started our first design with a dog bowl, then we went from dog bowl to a Pokemon shape. At first it was kind of confusing on how to create a bowl shape. Then Mr. Miller told us that we can use the revolve tool to make a bowl. I knew the revolve tool, but I never knew how to use it, so learning how to use the revolve tool was really interesting and helpful. After when I was done with 

### Code Relection-Hope
In the beginning of this project I was very dejeced and had little hope for this project since it was our back up plan. I did not kne
