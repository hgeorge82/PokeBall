This is the picture when we actually 3D printed the Pokemon ball and painted it.

This is what the inside looks like virtually and this is how it looks in person.

The red switch is when we are switching between code mode and data mode. Red wire = code mode Black wire = data mode

This is the final look, the reason why the bottom is a different color because we re-printed the bottom because the supports were broken

### What are the requirements for this assignment?
The requirements for this project are pico, GPS, PowerBoost, Accelerometer, Breadboard, USB adapter, Wires, bolts and nuts.

### Progress pictures

This is what our first design looked like. We didn't really know what our design would look like, so we came up with this design.

This is our final drawing

This is how everything will be on a breadboard.

Today we got our Pokemon ball printed. We put the board inside the Pokemon ball to see if it fits. Only 2 holes places are in the right place I am not sure why the other holes are not in the right place, but it still works and the board is where it is supposed to be, overall all it was good

This is right after we did the actual first launch, you can that it hit the ground pretty hard, and a lot of damage was done to it

This is when we first opened the ball, when we opened it the pico got stuck on the top you can see the spot of the pico. You can also see that the GPS, and powerboost came out of the headers and the buzzer is broken
<img src="https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/blob/main/Pictures/together.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
This is from our first launch, as you see the buzzer is fully broken, and everything is misplaced (got out of the headers)

<img src="https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/blob/main/Pictures/new%20supports.jpg?raw=true" width="400">
This is after the 2nd launch, as you see the supports were broken, so we had to recreate it and make the supports stronger. We made the support thicker and added these threaded inserts so that it's easier to put the screws in.

<img src="https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/blob/main/Pictures/top%20added%20foam.JPG?raw=true" width="400">
This is the bottom of the Pokemon ball, we added foam to prevent the pico-board from moving and we did the same thing at the top

## Launches 
![first launch](https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/assets/71345399/3e25ce41-f69f-438a-8127-bb3f8a4d066d)
This is our first test launch, the launch was ok, some materials inside it got misplaced, but overall it was a good launch


https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/assets/71345399/8b238c23-b037-465e-819f-fc85ebead58d

![2nd launch](https://github.com/hgeorge82/UFO-Drone/assets/71345399/c3a3cfcc-e579-404c-aa49-91bf7dd349a2)

This is our 1st actually launch. we did 2 launches that day, because why not you know? We had a pretty good launch, but it hit the ground pretty hard and a lot of damage was done to it. For instance, the ball was creaked open, and all of the materials inside it were broken, the pico support was broken and the pico support was broken

Data from this launch

This is our 3rd launch, some materials did get misplaced, but no damage was done



## Final_Reflections
 
### Mariam
This year has been a really challenging roller-coaster. In the beginning we had no idea how we want this project to look like, so we started our first design with a dog bowl, then we went from dog bowl to a Pokemon shape. At first it was kind of confusing on how to create a bowl shape. Then Mr. Miller told us that we can use the revolve tool to make a bowl. I knew the revolve tool, but I never knew how to use it, so learning how to use the revolve tool was really interesting and helpful. After I was done with CAD, and got the pokemon ball printed. I tried to get start on soldering, thanks to Hope she taught me how to solder. We had so many obstacles. For instance, when we were trying to get a fix for the GPA it wasn't working at first I am not really sure why, but I think it had something to do with the code. After we got that fixed after a couple of weeks, then we were not getting data which was so annoying. One time we got data and then when we were done with it. We thought it was finished, but the next day when we tested it again it wasn't working. OMG it was so annoying we couldn't tell what was wrong because it was it as working the day before and now when we tried it, so we kept trying and trying until we got it. Our real launch was a blast all of our materials got displaced and the support was broken, so we had to rebuil        d it. This time the support were stronger and we added foam to keep the pico from moving and it worked out pretty good. Overall I had so much fun doing this project and I learned a lot.  

### Hope
When we first started planning for our project this is not what I imagined I would be doing. We first planned for our project to be a UFO-Drone while the pokeball project was our back up plan. Our main code was our GPS code. I have never used GPS so this was very difficult to navigate. Using the example code we ran into a problem, the GPS was not collecting any data. In order to fix this problem we had to do some more research and ask Mr. Miller a bunch of questions in order for the code to work. Our code was working but we were struggling to colect data from the GPS. A few more questions and changes later we finally collected some data. Overall I defintely learned something... Do Not Use GPS For Any Projects!
